# **Problem Statement**
**Write Problem Statement Here.**
***1. Identify the Peak Demand Time Periods***
***2. Analyze the Supply-Demand Gap:*** *Identify time slots and pickup points (City vs Airport) where Uber has more requests than available drivers.*
***3. Explore Cancellation Patterns:*** *Identify when and where ride cancellations occur the most.*
***4. Investigate "No Cars Available" Issues:*** *Pinpoint peak times when users are not getting rides due to no available drivers.*
***5. Measure Average Driving Time (for Completed Rides):*** *Calculate time between Request timestamp and Drop timestamp.*
***6. Compare City vs Airport Ride Dynamics:*** *Compare request patterns, cancellation rates, and supply gaps between City and Airport pickups.*
***7. Understand Impact of Time Slots:*** *Identify which parts of the day need service improvement.*

**6. Reveals differences in rider behavior and service level.**
**7. Identify which parts of the day need service improvement.**

### What did you know about your "Raw Dataset"?

***The "* timestamp" columns are in object for need to extract date and time separately for operation***
***2650 Car request done by passengers but no cars was avilable***
***6745 rows Ã— 6 columns presented in the data set***
***Null values in "Driver id: 2650"
Null values in "Drop timestamp 3914"***
